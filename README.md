AvatarUpload
============

ASP.NET MVC 5 avatar upload implementation

This project can be used as example of how to implement avatar uploading and croping using jquery, jquery.form, and jcrop. It has some extra code to manipulate the image before saving it locally.

The project contains a AvatarController.cs controller that contains the backend code for receiving the uploaded file.
The Views/Avatar folder contain the main partial view that has three distinct parts - box for selecting a file and showing the progress of uploading, a box for cropping the image, and a box to display the result of the manipulation. All operations are done on one page (view) making it smooth.

Good luck!
